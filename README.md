    # Once inside the SDK's folder
    $ buildfire init webpack <pluginName>

## Usage
Be sure to be on the SDK's folder while running the following commands

`$ buildfire run <pluginName>` - Start the plugin viewer on the selected `pluginName`.

`$ buildfire build <pluginName>` - Build the selected `pluginName`
